# This is an example ICO web application

Steps to try demo –
1. You need the metamask or mist plugin for google chrome to interact with the dapp.
2. The contracts have been deployed to the rinkeby network. So you need to get some
rinkeby testnet ether. https://www.rinkeby.io/#faucet
3. After getting rinkeby testnet ether, navigate to the dapp. It is a very simplistic design to
give an idea.
4. You can see the total ether raised and the total tokens in supply.
5. To buy the tokens, you need to enter the amount in the ‘To buy Tokens’ dialog box and
enter the amount of ethers you want to buy for.
6. Metamask plugin will pop up and you can sign the transaction using metamask.
7. After signing the transaction, you can go to metamask plugin and check the last
transaction hash on etherscan
